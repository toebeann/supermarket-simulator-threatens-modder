## About the Source

Before we begin, I want to be very clear: **I am not the modder under threat of legal action**. The modder in question wishes to remain anonymous, but has granted permission for me to circulate this story. We'll refer to them as Pseudo. I did not know Pseudo before yesterday, and I cannot speak to their character.

I will not be extending the courtesy of anonymity to those who were acting as representatives of Supermarket Simulator and it's lead developer, Cannias.

However, I thought it pertinent to also provide some background about myself so you can decide for yourself how credible I am. [Skip ahead if you don't care](#what-happened).

I'm hosting this article on my [GitHub](https://github.com/toebeann/supermarket-simulator-threatens-modder) account (where I host the source code and wikis for my various projects) so you can see for yourself who I am. I am also hosting it on [rentry.co](https://rentry.co/sms-threatens-legal-action) for ease of readability.

The gist is that I've been around modding Unity games since 2020, mainly the Subnautica games. You'd know me for my snap-to-grid mods, my fast loading screen patch, the BepInEx packs for each game. I also contributed significant code to the most popular modding libraries for the games, and have written guides and built apps tailored for getting mods running on macOS, because otherwise it's a right pain in the behind for those guys. I also maintain the Vortex extensions which automatically install Subnautica mods on Windows. Basically, if you've made or run Subnautica mods since around August 2020, there's a 100% chance my code has been doing at least some of the heavy lifting, if not a little bit of singing and dancing, too.

I decided to make a custom tailored BepInEx pack for Supermarket Simulator shortly after I became aware of it, so I'm now pretty active in that community too, but it's still only just getting started, really. Unfortunately, I don't see a bright future ahead, if any.

## What Happened

> ‚Äú He'll most likely get a lawyer involved if he sees a mod like that. ‚Äù

After beginning work on a multiplayer mod for Supermarket Simulator, Pseudo posted in the official Supermarket Simulator discord server that they were working on the mod with a friend. Pseudo was warned for "advertising" by moderator zhanshiDE. Later, zhanshiDE messaged Pseudo privately, expressing interest in the multiplayer mod and asking to join Pseudo's discord server to keep up with its progress.

Noting that Cannias - the lead developer/project lead of Supermarket Simulator and admin of the official Supermarket Simulator discord server - was in the process of hiring developers to work on the game following its surprise success, Pseudo decided to try their luck, asking if zhanshiDE could forward a showcase of the mod to Cannias and if they could be considered for employment as a developer. zhanshiDE agreed, letting Pseudo know it could take up to a week to receive a response.

A little over an hour later, zhanshiDE reported that Cannias "doesn't agree with that." When asked to clarify, zhanshiDE gave the response: "because of the multiplayer." He went on to say that "[multiplayer is] planned, but I'm not allowed to say when. It's officially not planned." zhanshiDE then planted a red flag in the ground, stating that Cannias will "most likely get a lawyer involved if he sees a mod like that."

_**Note**: the conversation between Pseudo and zhanshiDE originally took place in German. It is shown here in a screenshot translated by [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&op=images).

> ‚Äú ... it'd cause millions of dollars [in damages] to the dev. ‚Äù

4 days later, Pseudo notified princess - another moderator of the official Supermarket Simulator discord server - that they intended to release their multiplayer mod soon, expressing a desire to discuss the situation with Cannias if possible.

princess told Pseudo: "[Cannias] can't chat with anyone since he's busy with the business," that Pseudo should "avoid any kind of multiplayer mod for Supermarket Simulator," that "any kind of multiplayer mods are not allowed in any shape since it'd cause millions of dollars [in damages] to [Cannias]."

Pseudo tried to assuage their concerns, stating that "[the multiplayer mod] will go out to only a limited amount of people." Pseudo further asserted that their mod "is not [going to] cause any damage," giving the reasoning that "the people who want multiplayer either already have the game, or would buy the game because of [my multiplayer mod]." It wasn't stated during this converation, but Pseudo has expressed to me that they intended for their mod to be something of a stopgap until the official multiplayer update gets released.

> ‚Äú Mods are never legal. All legal actions are taken against all [multiplayer] mods. ‚Äù

Pseudo released a test build of the mod in the early hours of the next morning, only making it available to select members of their choosing, as well as to some members of the unofficial Supermarket Simulator modding discord server.

The following afternoon, princess followed up on their previous conversation, stating that "Mods are never legal," that "legal actions are taken against all [multiplayer] mods," that there is "no bargin, no agreement, no negotiation [to be had] related to this."

> ‚Äú this is bullshit ‚Äù

Pseudo informed the testers of their mod that they now intended to "abandon the project", citing threats of legal action as the reason, and went on to share screenshots of these threats when questioned about the situation, with the names of the moderators censored.

One tester of the mod, S4m, was notably appalled by the response from Supermarket Simulator's moderation team, stating "this is bullshit," and pondered "why would a multiplayer mod effect the games sales by millions if the update is going to be free?" S4m was referring to a statement made by Cannias in the official Supermarket Simulator discord server the previous day:

![A screenshot of Cannias making the following statement: "No DLC planned for a while. All will be free updates. Multiplayer is on the table now. We'll see what we can do about it." The statement was made in a public channel of the official Supermarket Simulator discord server, and has 8 heart-eyed reactions from users.](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/toebeann/supermarket-simulator-threatens-modder/main/screenshots/4-cannias-free-updates.png)

> ‚Äú It's not threats. It is true.. ‚Äù

> ‚Äú Please ban who spreads misinformation mods üôÇ ‚Äù

Incredulous, S4m and I decided to check in with the official Supermarket Simulator discord server about the situation. After S4m stated that Pseudo had been threatened with legal action over their mod, princess responded: "It's not threats. It is true. No need to spread misinformation like that." princess also invited S4m to post screenshots in the screenshots channel. These screenshots were promptly deleted by moderators, without any discussion of their content.

_**Note:** In the following screenshots, red text and greyed out images/emojis indicate messages that have since been deleted or edited, recovered by a third-party discord add-on that stores deleted/edited messages locally._

In the screenshot, S4m mentions a multiplayer mod which was in the works, and that apparently the modder got bullied/threatened with legal action by a moderator. When a user replied that no moderator would threaten or bully someone, S4m indicated the desire to post screenshot evidence. All text from S4m is in red, unlike everybody else's.](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/toebeann/supermarket-simulator-threatens-modder/main/screenshots/5a-s4m.png)

![A screenshot of a section of conversation, continuing from the last. princess replies to S4m, pointing them to the screenshots channel, then shortly after states: "It's not threats. It is true.." princess follows up again with the message "No need to spread misinformation like that." S4m replies "what," followed by "I assumed it was threats since the way they worded it." princess responds "It's not, it's just advice so they don't get into any trouble," signing off the message with an ASCII smiley face. S4m continues: "and the guy making the mod said it as if they were threats", "also by the way it wouldn't plummet the sails by millions." An onlooking user notes that "tone doesn't convey over text." All text from S4m is in red, unlike everybody else's.](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/toebeann/supermarket-simulator-threatens-modder/main/screenshots/5b-s4m-princess.png)

![A screenshot from the screenshots community channel in the official Supermarket Simulator discord server, showing a message from S4m timestamped shortly after the message from princess pointing them to where they can post screenshots from the previous section. The message reads: "heres the proof if any of yall want it." The text from S4m is in red. Attached are two screenshots between Pseudo and a moderator whose name cannot be made out because it was censored by Pseudo. They contain the same text as the screenshots between princess and Pseudo in which princess stated that multiplayer mods are not allowed, that mods are not legal, that legal actions are taken against these kinds of mods, etc. The images are greyed out. A few minutes later, there is a message with tobey with one of the same screenshots and no text. This image is also greyed out.](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/toebeann/supermarket-simulator-threatens-modder/main/screenshots/5c-s4m-tobey.png)

Shortly after S4m posted these screenshots, Cannias called on the moderators to ban anyone spreading misinformation.

![A screenshot of a section of conversation, continuing back in the English chat channel of the official Supermarket Simulator discord. Shortly after S4m's last message in that channel and the follow up from a user pointing out that "tone doesn't convey over text," Cannias is seen saying: "Please ban who spreads misinformation mods", followed by a smiley face emoji. S4m replies "I didn't mean to." Nobody replies to S4m, ignoring him. Cannias and some users start talking about how the game has sold millions of copies. All text from S4m is in red, unlike everybody else's.](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/toebeann/supermarket-simulator-threatens-modder/main/screenshots/5d-cannias-s4m.png)

Having myself not noticed that S4m had shared screenshots (they were deleted by the time I went to look), I also shared a screenshot of the conversation with princess - the one containing the language conveying a threat (or warning if you want to be charitable) of legal action. This screenshot was deleted by a moderator mere moments after I posted it. When I tried to point out that moderators were deleting screenshots that would prove what S4m is saying is not simple misinformation, S4m and I both found ourselves immediately banned from the server, with all of our previous messages erased.

That's why our text is in red and the images we sent were greyed out - when you are banned from a discord server, the person banning you can optionally delete your entire message history from the server, which they did.

![A screenshot of a section of conversation, continuing from the last. Shortly after the conversation between Cannias and some users celebrating how many copies of the game have been sold, tobey is seen stating: "one of the moderators/admins just deleted my image showing it is a threat of legal aaction, from the screenshots channel." A user replies "The responses weren't threats." tobey messages again, loosely quoting one of the deleted screenshots "all legal action will be taken. this type of mod will never be allowed." All text from tobey is in red, unlike everybody else's.](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/toebeann/supermarket-simulator-threatens-modder/main/screenshots/5e-tobey.png)

## Decide for Yourself

The moderators of the official Supermarket Simulator discord server appear to report directly to Cannias. They act on his behalf, they speak on his behalf. For all intents and purposes, they are representatives of Cannias - the lead developer and project lead for Supermarket Simulator.

If these moderators state that legal action will be taken against multiplayer mods - does that constitute simple "advice," or a tangible threat of legal action from the game devs of Supermarket Simulator? What if another member of the same team expressed the belief that Cannias would "likely get a lawyer involved"?

Were these simply the words of rogue or misguided moderators, who were not themselves instructed to lean on Pseudo by Cannias, to make Pseudo fear that legal action would be forthcoming if they continued working on the mod?

Now, I'm sure some of you will point out that princess' exact words were "All legal actions are taken against all these kinds of mods." princess did not specifically state they _will_ take action against multiplayer mods or Pseudo. However, my read on this is that it is a simple grammatical error. A more charitable interpretation would go something like "legal actions _are_ taken by _some other_ people _sometimes_ for _some other_ multiplayer mods," but:

1. This sentence does not feel like it fits neatly in the context of those surrounding it, it would come somewhat out of the blue.
2. Why would you bring up that other multiplayer mods have legal action taken against them, if not to imply that it might happen to Pseudo if they do not cease and desist? It doesn't make any sense to me to say this except to try and intimidate Pseudo, or to warn them of a genuine intent to bring legal action again them.

No matter how I try to justify this, it doesn't look good for Cannias and his team of moderators.

Given everything, I personally believe that Pseudo should consider the "advice" from zhanshiDE and princess to be real threats of legal action, made on behalf of Cannias. I certainly do.

Threatening legal action against mods for stealing your thunder, deleting evidence of these conversations and banning people for sending them... these are an awful lot of red flags. If you care about mods, Supermarker Simulator seems like a sinking ship, and I'm putting on my life jacket.

But maybe I'm not seeing things clearly.
